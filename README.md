## Running locally

You will need to use the environment variables [defined in `.env.example`](.env.example) to run Tanstack Start Gemini Chatbot.

> Note: You should not commit your `.env` file or it will expose secrets that will allow others to control access to your various Google Cloud and authentication provider accounts.

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pnpm install # npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file based on [`.env.example`](./.env.example).

4. Push the schema to your database with drizzle-kit:

   ```bash
   pnpm db push # npm run db push
   ```
